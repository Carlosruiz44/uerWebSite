            <h3>Label Definitions</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h4><b>Generation Price:</b></h4>
            <p>The Generation Price does not include charges for Distribution Service, other Department regulated services or other non-generation products of services. All customers are provided the price based on the applicable Agreement Terms of Service).  The price does not change with usage level.  See your most recent bill for your monthly use and actual prices.  Contact Utility Expense Reduction, LLC for more information.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Power Sources:</b></h4>
            <p>Utility Expense Reduction procures its electricity supply, on behalf of its customers, from system power contracts, not from specific generating units.  The electricity you consume comes from the New England power grid, which receives power from a variety of power plants and transmits the power throughout the region as needed to meet the requirements of all customers in New England.</p>
            <p>System Power represents power purchased in the regional electricity market.  The System Power distribution presented in the table is based on the most recently available information provided via the NEPOOL Generation Information System.  When you choose a power supplier, that supplier is responsible for generating and/or purchasing power that is added to the power grid in an amount equivalent to your electricity use.  Known Resources include resources that are owned by, or under contract to, the supplier.  System Power represents power purchased in the regional electricity market.  Biomass refers to power plants that are fueled by wood or other plant matter.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Emissions:</b></h4>
            <p>for each of the following pollutants are presented as a percent of the regional average emission rate.  Arrows represent the emission rate from a hypothetical new generation facility.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Carbon Dioxide: (CO2) </b></h4>
            <p>(CO2) is released when fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, and natural gas) are burned.  Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a major contributor to global warming.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Nitrogen Oxides: (NOx) </b></h4>
            <p>(NOx) forms when fossil fuels and biomass are burned at high temperatures.  They contribute to acid rain and ground-level ozone (or smog), and may cause respiratory illness in children with frequent high level exposure. NOX also contributes to oxygen deprivation of lakes and coastal waters which is destructive to fish and other animal life.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Sulfur Dioxide: (SO2) </b></h4>
            <p>(SO2) forms when fuels containing sulfur are burned, primarily coal and oil.  Major health effects associated with SO2 include asthma, respiratory illness and aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease.  SO2 combines with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which raises the acid level of lakes and streams, and accelerates the decay of buildings and monuments.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4><b>Labor Information:  </b></h4>
            <p>The information on this label regarding whether generators or suppliers operate under collective bargaining agreements is provided to inform you about whether the energy was produced in plants where employee wages and working conditions are mutually determined by employees and management, and protected by union contracts.  The information in this label regarding the use of replacement employees during a labor dispute is provided to inform you of whether or not a generator or supplier, during a strike by or lock-out of its employees, has replaced them with other workers.</p>
