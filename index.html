        In the mid 1990s, former New York Governor Pataki signed into law what amounted to the deregulation of the monopolized utilities. This law now gives consumers the choice when it comes to the supply of natural gas and electricity. Deregulation broke down the monopoly and opened up the market to other providers known as Energy Service Companies (ESCOs). By deregulating the market, all suppliers now compete on the basis of price and service. For more information on the history of deregulation in the state of New York, visit the Public Service Commission’s website.

        As an ESCO, Utility Expense Reduction offers competitive prices, personalized services, and innovative solutions. This gives both residential and business consumers the opportunity to pick the purchasing strategy that best suits their needs
